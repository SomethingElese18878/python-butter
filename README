 Butter
========
Butter is a library to integrate some of linux's low level features into python
eg signalfd, eventfd and timerfd. most of these functions are handy if you are 
looking into creating non-blocking servers, anything using select/poll and 
derivatives or writing server code

Design
-------
where posible access to the raw calls has been made avalible as well as providing 
a file like object that ahs been extended (hereby refered to as an "event like" 
object. steps have been taken to preserve the current file like api calling
conventions however be warned that doing partial reads using obj.read may cause
issues for eventlike objects that work with constant sizes and as such the event
functions should be called instead

Event-like objects
+++++++++++++++++++
eventlike objects have been extended in the following way:
getevent() -> event
getevents(count=1) -> [event, .....]
